# wheres-waldo-game

This project is built using react. '
This project is deployed on github pages. 
As soon as you enter the page a count will start, which will start counting the number of seconds it takes for you to find the characters.
you can click on the "click for character details" on the header and find out which characters you are supposed to find.
After you have done that you will be finding the characters in this chaotic image, once found you can click on them and select the "character name" of the character that you believe you have found there.
If you clicked on a character and then selected that character's name it will turn to green color with a checkmark next to it.
Otherwise nothing will happen

as soon as you find all of the characters. the count will stop and it will display the amount of time it took you to find all of the characters.
and there will be a pretty confetti effect.
